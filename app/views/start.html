      <p>Use this service to submit a concern or complaint about the safety of a high-rise building, if:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you live in the high-rise building OR</li>
        <li>you're acting on behalf of someone who lives in the high-rise building OR</li>
        <li>your job requires spending time in the high-rise building</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A high-rise building has at least 7 storeys, or is 18m high and <i>either</i> has at least 2 residential units or is a hospital or care home (during design and construction).</p>

      {% from "govuk/components/warning-text/macro.njk" import govukWarningText %}

{{ govukWarningText({
  text: "If your complaint concerns an immediate risk of injury or death, please call 999.",
  iconFallbackText: "Warning"
}) }}

<p>Before using this service you must first raise the concern or complaint with your building manager (if you own the property) or your landlord (if you rent the property) and give them reasonable time to respond.</p>

      <p>You can choose to remain anonymous to your building manager (and all building staff) within this process.</p>

      <p>Submitting a concern or complaint takes around 5 minutes.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens when you raise a complaint</h2>

      <p>After your complaint is submitted, it will be read by the Building Safety Regulator’s triage team (a team who review building safety complaints). They will decide: </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>if this complaint has come to the right place</li>
        <li>if there have been other similar complaints already made</li>
        <li>if any more information or evidence is needed</li>
        <li>the severity level of the complaint (red or amber) </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Once this has been decided (within 48 hours of receiving the complaint) you will be contacted with the next steps.</p>
      <p>For amber level complaints, the triage team will contact you and the accountable person for the building to resolve the issue remotely.</p>
      <p>For red level complaints, there will be a complaints inspector assigned who will deal directly with the building’s accountable person, arranging an inspection, writing up a report, and – if the complaint is upheld – working with the accountable person to resolve the issue. If there has been a breach of law, this may lead to enforcement (the accountable person will be forced to solve the issue).</p>
      <p>If you have asked to be anonymous, the BSR will not reveal your identity to the accountable person and all correspondence will be separate.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When not to use this service</h2>

      <p>You should not use this service if your concern or complaint is about:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

        <li>violent crime or theft (call the non-emergency police line on 150)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>

      <p>You'll be asked for details about who you've already raised this concern to and when. You'll also be asked to provide any supporting documentation (such as photographs of the issue or any relevant email exchanges).</p>
