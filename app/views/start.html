      <p>Use this service to submit a concern or complaint about the safety of a high-rise building, if:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you live in the high-rise building OR</li>
        <li>you're acting on behalf of someone who lives in the high-rise building OR</li>
        <li>your job requires spending time in the high-rise building</li>
      </ul>

      {% from "govuk/components/warning-text/macro.njk" import govukWarningText %}
